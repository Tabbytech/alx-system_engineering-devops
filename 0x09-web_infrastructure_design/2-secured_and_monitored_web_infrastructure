Explanations:

1. Firewalls (3x):
   Protect each public-facing server by filtering incoming/outgoing traffic.
2. SSL Certificate:
   Enables HTTPS to encrypt data between user and Load Balancer.
3. Monitoring Clients (Sumologic agents):
   Collect metrics/logs and send to monitoring system.

Monitoring QPS:

- Monitoring tools can collect data from NGINX access logs or DB queries per second.

Infrastructure Issues:

- SSL termination at Load Balancer: Internal communication is unencrypted.
- Database SPOF: Single Primary node is a failure risk.
- Tightly Coupled Components: Web/App layers not yet separated, limiting scalability.
